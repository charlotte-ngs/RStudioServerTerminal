## Disclaimer
This document describes a solution for the problem of unavailable terminals in RStudio Server.


## Problem
After logging into an RStudio Server, the terminal session could not be loaded. This problem occurs when the terminal window which is by the default in the lower left corner is empty and does not show a shell prompt. An example of an empty window is shown in the screenshot below.


```{r EmtpyTerminal, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "png/EmptyTerminal.png")
```


## Solution
One solution that worked for me is described at https://community.rstudio.com/t/cannot-use-terminal-no-window-contents/2808/6. In the options of the terminal, we have to find the one that must be de-selected. The following steps worked for me.


### Step 1: Close currently open Terminal-Tab
In case the Terminal-Tab is open close it with the `x`

```{r CloseTerminal, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "png/CloseTerminal.png")
```


### Step 2: Change global option
In the menu `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Terminal`, de-select the option `Connect with WebSockets`. After that it should look as follows. 

```{r TerminalOption, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "png/TerminalOption.png")
```


### Step 3: Start a new terminal
New terminals are started in `Tools` > `Terminal` > `New Terminal`


```{r NewTerminal, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "png/NewTerminal.png")
```


### Resultat
Als Resultat sollten wir einen Terminal-Tab mit funktionierendem Terminal haben.

```{r ResultTerminal, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "png/ResultTerminal.png")
```
